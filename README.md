Greetings! 

I'm Sancho Caayao, Electrical Engineer, experienced Admin & Operations Manager, and now evolving into an AI, Tech, and Software Professional. With a solid foundation in engineering principles and extensive experience in managing operations, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table.

Current Focus

I'm currently dedicated to expanding my expertise in Python coding while actively contributing to the development and optimisation of Customer Relationship and Resource Management Systems for my son's company. This project allows me to apply my knowledge and skills in both operations management and technology, driving efficiency and innovation in the business.
